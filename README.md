# About me ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Magdalena Valcheva also known as MagsDraw.
You can find me on any social media with this nickname.

I'm a young lady passionate about art, gaming, sport and IT.

I'm interested in becoming a Web Developer in this chapter of my life.
I am currently learning HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, and Jquery.


For starters, I've focused on Frond-End Wed Dev. But I want to make it Full Stack.
